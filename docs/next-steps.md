Next Steps (For The Next Session)

Context

- Your `.venv` and installed dependencies (incl. CUDA PyTorch, decord) will remain. We will not recreate or uninstall anything.
- Project is uv‑managed with `pyproject.toml` and a lockfile; however, since the venv is intact, we can use it as‑is.
- First MiniCPM‑V 4.5 run will require downloading model weights from Hugging Face (`openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4_5`). Network approval may be needed.

What I’ll implement first

- CLI scaffold: `lightning-detector` command (argparse) with subcommand `scan`.
- Video sampling:
  - Uniform frame sampling (`choose_fps`, `MAX_NUM_FRAMES`).
  - Optional 3D‑Resampler temporal packing (`temporal_ids`) path.
- Prompt + inference:
  - Build strict JSON prompt for lightning detection.
  - Call `model.chat` with frames and decode options (`use_image_id`, `max_slice_nums`, optional `enable_thinking`).
- Robust JSON parsing:
  - Handle minor formatting issues; fallback to extracting JSON block.
- Outputs:
  - Write `reports/<basename>.json` and `reports/<basename>.txt`.
  - Index summary file (basic table of detections) in `reports/index.txt`.

Initial CLI flags (subject to tweak)

- `--input DIR` (default: `videos/`)
- `--output DIR` (default: `reports/`)
- `--fps INT` (default: 5)
- `--packing INT` (default: 0 for off; 1–6 when on)
- `--max-frames INT` (cap after sampling; default sensible)
- `--max-slice-nums INT` (for hi‑res frames; default 1)
- `--thinking` (enable deep thinking mode; default off)

Assumptions & Notes

- We’ll skip the brightness‑spike prefilter initially.
- JSON schema v1 from `docs/plan.md` will be used; we can extend later.
- Expect an initial prompt‑tuning pass after we test on a few clips for recall.

What I’ll ask you for on return

- Approval to download the MiniCPM‑V 4.5 weights on first run (if not already cached).
- Optionally, one 20–60s clip we can use as a quick test during development.

How you can prepare (optional)

- Ensure SSH GitHub repo is created and pushed (see `docs/restart.md`).
- Activate the existing venv before starting the next session: `source .venv/bin/activate`.
